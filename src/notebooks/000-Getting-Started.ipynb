    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook which uses the file extension `.ipynb`. **Jupyter Notebooks** are interactive environments for REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) instruction sets that allow work to be shared among colleagues consistently and reproducibly, eg. The code blocks may be saved with their respective outputs **OR** The code blocks may be altered and re-evaluated during subsequent sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the `.ipynb` file-type, there are a few common options which we'll explore:\n",
    "- Jupyter Server\n",
    "- VSCode's Jupyter Package\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential benefit associated with the overhead of hosting a Jupyter Server is that it allows multiple team members to access and edit the notebook simultaneously in a shared session. This technique is commonly employed to streamline Big Data operations among Titans of Industry. For more information, check out the list of current users on the [Official Site](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the list includes the following:\n",
    "- Microsoft\n",
    "- Google\n",
    "- Oracle\n",
    "- IBM\n",
    "- NASA\n",
    "- Bloomberg\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft is notorious for *\"eating their own dog food\"* and they've found uses for Jupyter notebooks in their operations!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Jupyter notebook consists of units called \"blocks.\" A **block** may either be a **markdown block** for storing text or a **code block** for storing code written in various interactive programming languages including: python, R, and Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon running the block either the formatted text will be rendered or the code will be evaluated and any output printed. Otherwise, code blocks will likely print the output of the last statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document/notebook/workbook structure allows for hosting documentation and relevant code alongside each other without introducing excessive comments in the code making it more difficult to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where's the Value? (The proof is in the pudding)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reality is that VBA (and similar equivalent) codebases quickly become unmanageable and unmaintainable. python reinforces readability, extensibility, cross-platform operability, and Guido van Rossum (the creator of the language) insists upon writing self-documenting code rather than clever code. There's also likely to be one product expert that understands the **intended** functionality of your VBA codebase and that has the potential to spell real-world consequences for business operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are currently maintaining a VBA codebase, I would ask you to consider the possibility of migrating your code from VBA to python. VBA itself is riddled with anti-patterns and antiquated conventions. Also, it does not entirely support modern OOP (Object Oriented Programming) conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, To remove column(s) in VBA one is forced to reverse iterate over the Column objects comparing each Cell value to either an index or String value stored in a list (Variant). The reason that a reverse loop is required is that it's generally frowned upon to modify a collection while iterating over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach carries the likelihood of creating bugs by introducing overly complicated boilerplate code or possibly creating an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible benefit is that modern colleges typically use either Java or python for students. It's a universal glue language for students, teachers, data scientists, analysts, and web developers, etc... Therefore, it's ubiquitous and will likely receive extended use among professionals for its ease and broad applications in prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, follow along with the following code samples which demonstrate performing the same operation in both VBA and python: removing a collection of columns by their header name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VBA\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample, a sub-routine named `ReverseIterateAndDeleteColumns()` is defined which takes no arguments and iterates through the Columns of the ActiveWorksheet and a Variant containing column names for which we want to remove the entire column.\n",
    "\n",
    "```vba\n",
    "' Require \"explicit\" variable datatype declarations prior to assignment\n",
    "Option Explicit\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub ReverseIterateAndDeleteColumns()\n",
    "    Dim ws As Worksheet\n",
    "    Dim rng As Range\n",
    "    Dim colCount As Integer\n",
    "    Dim colArray As Variant\n",
    "\n",
    "    ' set the active worksheet\n",
    "    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets('Sheet1')\n",
    "\n",
    "    ' define a list of columns to delete\n",
    "    colArray = Array(\"Delete\", \"These\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    ' reverse iterate through columns because VBA\n",
    "    For colCount = ws.Cells(1, ws.Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column to 1 Step -1\n",
    "        Set rng = ws.Cells(1, colCount)\n",
    "        If Not IsError(Application.Match(rng.Value, colArray, 0)) Then\n",
    "            ' cell Value is in the array so delete it\n",
    "            rng.EntireColumn.Delete\n",
    "        End If\n",
    "    Next colCount\n",
    "End Sub\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparitively, if we were to use python + pandas + openpyxl for the same operation which may appear significantly more intuitive and direct.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import library dependencies\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# create file path accessor\n",
    "worksheet = Path(\"../data/Spreadsheet.xlsx\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# read file contents into a DataFrame\n",
    "df = pd.read_excel(worksheet)\n",
    "\n",
    "# declare keep vs delete columns (for multiple approach)\n",
    "keep_columns = [\"Do\", \"Not\", \"Remove\"]\n",
    "delete_columns = [\"Delete\", \"These\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# SELECT what you want to keep rather than EXCLUDING what you don't want\n",
    "new_df = df[keep_columns]\n",
    "\n",
    "# OR feel free to REMOVE the columns via 'list comprehension'\n",
    "# \"Have it YOUR way\"\n",
    "[df.pop(c) for c in delete_columns]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice to extend the python code portion to cover multiple approaches was so that the script length would be comparable to the VBA version for similar operations (and it's still shorter).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Modest Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're still not convinced, please follow along with this series. In the following entries, I will demonstrate common applications for a full fledged Swiss army data science and analysis toolkit in daily business operations."
