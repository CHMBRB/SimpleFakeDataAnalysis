A lot of python coders frequently use them to excess but that doesn't mean that they're optimal. In truth, more complex comprehension syntax expressions may become difficult to read for multi-dimensional arrays. It's probably more accurate to compare comprehension syntax to anonymous functions because they ultimately may need to be refactored or avoided entirely. \n",
