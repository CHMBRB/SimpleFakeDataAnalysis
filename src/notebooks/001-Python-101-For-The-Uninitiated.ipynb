    "In python, **everything** is an object and retains special properties and functions which are commonly referred to as **methods**.\n",

    "Properties are similar accessors which do not require a following parenthetical function/method call (), ie. object.key, object.attr, object.name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, Strings have string methods, integers have integer methods, iterables have different iterable methods depending on the type, etc... Some of the methods are surrounded by double underscores like `__init__`, `__dict__`, `__str__`, `__eq__`, `__enter__`, `__exit__`, `__iter__`. These methods are colloquially called **dunder, special, or magic** methods and may be overridden for user-defined and other derived objects.\n",

    "Python is a \"duck-typed\" language which loosely translates as:\n",
    "> \"if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it must be a duck\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that users aren't required to state variable data types prior to use because the **python interpreter** will anticipate data types on assignment. Then users may either explicitly cast variables or perform type-checking as deemed necessary.\n",

    "### Common Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote the Go Programming language: \"There is a while loop in Go. It's spelled f-o-r.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In python things are a little more verbose because there's a few loop types including the `for` and `while` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `for` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop is the most commonly used loop type in python. It instantiates a variable which serves as each individual instance of a collection for each loop. In practice that generally has this appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_list = [\"apples\", \"bananas\", \"oranges\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in some_list:\n",
    "    print(f\"Yay! I like {fruit}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Nested `for` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops may be nested within one another similar to the following\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_ints = [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "some_strs = [\"apples\", \"bananas\", \"oranges\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in some_ints:\n",
    "    print(f\"current integer => {i}\")\n",
    "    for s in some_strs:\n",
    "        print(f\"current string => {s}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looping w/ `zip()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, if we wanted to enumerate and merge multiple lists then we may use the built-in `zip()` function. This approach will truncate any unmatched values meaning that if `some_ints` were to only contain 2 entries, then oranges will not print.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_ints = [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "some_strs = [\"apples\", \"bananas\", \"oranges\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for i,s in zip(some_ints, some_strs):\n",
    "    print(f\"current integer => {i}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"current string => {s}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# NOTE: loop over unmatched/truncated values\n",
    "some_ints.pop()\n",
    "for i,s in zip(some_ints, some_strs):\n",
    "    print(f\"current integer => {i}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"current string => {s}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` keyword is another technique for constructing loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while counter <= 10:\n",
    "    print(f\"counter => {counter}\")\n",
    "    # then update counter otherwise we will encounter an \"infinite loop\"\n",
    "    counter += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `while`/`for` Nested Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_list = [\"apples\", \"bananas\", \"oranges\"]\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# top level while statement\n",
    "while counter <= 10:\n",
    "    # NOTE: the break keyword may be used to end the top level `while` statement (which may produce an infinite loop if we'd established a `while True` loop)\n",
    "    # NOTE: the continue keyword may be used to pass a single loop and continue the next execution\n",
    "    if counter >= 6:\n",
    "        print(f\"Counter will never reach a value of 10 because of the break keyword.\")\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    # iterate over the list items\n",
    "    for fruit in some_list:\n",
    "        print(f\"Counter value before: {counter}\")\n",
    "        print(fruit)\n",
    "        counter += 2\n",
    "        print(f\"Counter value after: {counter}\")\n",
    "            \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionally the `while` statement above doesn't do much because it's just an example. However, for an async program the statement may be used to capture errors and restart the application after a fault occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looping w/ `range()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check out looping with `range()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "some_list = [\"apples\", \"bananas\", \"oranges\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# iterate over a given lists entry length\n",
    "for index in range(len(some_list)):\n",
    "    print(some_list[index])\n",
    "\n",
    "# iterate over numbers\n",
    "for index in range(10):\n",
    "    print(f\"The current count is: {index}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# iterate over numbers reverse using start, stop, and step (in reverse order)\n",
    "for index in range(10, 0, -2):\n",
    "    print(f\"the current count is: {index}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` command optionally accepts 3 arguments which include: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. However, if only one is provided then it is the stop value. So how about looping over a dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looping Over Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "some_dict = {\"monday\": \"apples\", \"tuesday\": \"bananas\", \"wednesday\": \"oranges\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# NOTE: the usage of the dict() method `items()`\n",
    "for k,v in some_dict.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"On {k} we will have {v}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The final demonstration is slightly more complex because we will loop over a list of dictionary objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "some_list_of_dictionary = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Amanda\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 22},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Edgar\", \"age\": 32},\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# using .format() syntax once more to demonstrate multi-variable use with named variable arguments\n",
    "# NOTE: parametized inputs syntax\n",
    "print_statement = \"The user {name} is {age} years old\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# loop for the list, ie. accessing 1 dict() object per loop\n",
    "for entry in some_list_of_dictionary:\n",
    "    print(print_statement.format(name=entry[\"name\"], age=entry[\"age\"]))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Appending Dictionaries To List\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very common to see in python code. Outside of a loop, an empty list will be initialized and while looping over an array dictionary objects may be created and/or updated and then appended to the list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "list_of_dict = []\n",
    "# create an empty dictionary outside of the loop to minimize processing overhead\n",

In truth, more complex comprehension syntax expressions may become difficult to read for multi-dimensional arrays. It's probably more accurate to compare comprehension syntax to anonymous functions because they ultimately may need to be refactored or avoided entirely. \n",

    "\n",
    "This may occur in base context, within functions, or even within class instantiations and related methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Unpacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we haven't previously discussed unpacking here's a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# declare a list of 3 items\n",

    "apples, bananas = fruits\n",
    "apples, bananas, oranges, berries = fruits\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to the question is `Error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, for less than the number of entries we receive the error: `ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)` and for more than the number of entries receive the following error: `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unpacking w/ Designated Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unpacking Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first option is to utilize the following pattern in normal interpreter sessions.\n",

    "Note that a minimum of 3 items need to exist in the array in order for the above code to work, otherwise, we run the risk of eliciting the same errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final example of this behavior may be observed in a function or method declaration.\n",

    "#### File-System Object Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build our own context managers for custom defined user classes, let's explore a well known object which includes a context manager the `open()` function and it's application using the `with` keyword. (This is similar to the application of the `finally` [file closing error-catching function above](#error-catching-function-w-explicit-garbage-collection) except the `with` keyword automatically disposes resources once the code block is no longer in scope).\n",

    "        print(line)\n",
    "        # upon completing the final loop, the file is automatically closed and resources are disposed\n",
    "        # similarly if an error were to occur the `with` keyword ensures that resources are garbage collected\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Defined Class Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example isn't very practical because it makes more sense to maintain the engine (or optionally a session object) in a specific namespace to be reserved for future use.

    "# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the information in this section evolved out of the '90s and attempts to standardize practices to minimize cost to avoid MNC (multi-national corporation) outsourcing of programming activities. Some influential people met in Utah to discuss \"added value services\", \"minimum viable products\", and identify opportunities to advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language and this section will demonstrate how this can be leveraged to create custom objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Program to an interface, not an implementation\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, python doesn't support interfaces that create \"contracts\" which define the required supported attributes, properties, and methods of a class instance. That's a feature of compiled languages and we're in the land of pure polymorphism. That's not to say that we can't implement our own interfaces, but why would we want to? &mdash; We use python for a reason, why fight against the chosen tool when we embrace it?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four pillars of OOP **(these will come up in software developer job interviews)**:\n",
    "- Abstraction\n",
    "- Encapsulation\n",
    "- Inheritance\n",
    "- Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "The following definitions were adapted from this [Geeks for Geeks Post](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/four-main-object-oriented-programming-concepts-of-java/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "> Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and exposes only the functionality to the user. In abstraction, we deal with ideas and not events. This means the user will only know “what it does” rather than “how it does”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "> Encapsulation is the process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "> Inheritance is the process of one class inheriting properties and methods from another class. Inheritance is used when we have is-a relationship between objects. Inheritance implementations vary by language. In python this is achieved with the ':' next to a class definition followed by the parent/base class names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "> Polymorphism is the ability to perform many things in many ways. The word Polymorphism is from two different Greek words- poly and morphs. “Poly” means many, and “Morphs” means forms. So polymorphism means many forms. The polymorphism can be present in the case of inheritance also. The functions behave differently based on the actual implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SOLID\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- I'm not reallly sure that I want to cover all of this, but it's good to have a start -->\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID is an acronym for describing OOP classes and should guide how our objects are designed. Some of these may not make as much since in the context of Python as a programming language, but we'll demonstrate the intent either way. The following materials were adapted from this [Digital Ocean Post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single-Responsibility Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open-Closed Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation: IF a parent/base class has a method which accepts a string, THEN any child/derived class which overrides that method SHALL also accept a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface Segregation Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces don't really exist in python, but classes may be inherited and used in a similar fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Inversion Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Patterns and The \"Gang of Four\" (GoF)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) was a book published in 1994 which evaluates different techniques used to produce objects. While it is still relevant for discussing designs and understanding code, the contained examples are written in C++('94) and Smalltalk. To be continued..."
