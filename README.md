# Simple Fake Data Analysis

This project is the spiritual successor to the [Simple Fake Data Utility](https://github.com/CHMBRB/SimpleFakeDataUtility) repo and will rely upon that project's output for analysis.

## Objective

To demonstrate the ease of use and advantages associated with using the __[python pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)__ (Panel Data) library for analytical computing.

### Why?

VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) *was* a preferred candidate for scripting in the days of once before because it is a one-stop shop that doesn't require additional Active Directory permissions or administrative oversight in a Windows environment.

Pros:
- it receives the benefit of cross-applications within the Microsoft Office Suite: Access, Excel, Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint

Cons:
- it's proprietary
- it's expensive
- it's inefficient, eg. it's a resource hog
- it's based on the Visual Basic programming language which doesn't conform to modern OOP (Object Oriented Programming) conventions
- there are better open-source alternatives

### Why make things more difficult? KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) method.

To quote the introductory PERL programming language title: "Making Easy Things Easy And Hard Things Possible"

Why, as professionals, should we insist upon increasing the difficulty of our work when that's not a healthy performance metric and there's no related achievement award? ***"Work smart, not hard."***

The Office Suite products (and their LibreOffice equivalents) are still invaluable tools for quick data entry, editing, viewing, and analysis. However, they're not without limitations. Therefore, python, pandas, etc... are not meant to entirely replace, but to be used in conjunction with existing tools.

### The Problem

In business operations, we rely upon operational consistency, and as such, wish to minimize the possible introduction of "Expert Premiums" because the cost to rehire, retrain, and retain generally outweigh the opportunity cost of pursuing other options.

The adage "Under Promise, Over Deliver" holds great personal significance thanks to Scotty from Star Trek always being quoted as: "Captain, I'm giving her all I've got!" just before he comes through in a clutch moment. Similarly, I don't feel a strong desire to prove myself through [Sisyphean activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus). Learn a toolkit with high utility and stick with it until a better tool comes along. There's no room for the "Law of the Instrument" in technologically driven industries.

## A Note About Pandas

<!-- TODO: transition this section to a note about some of the included libraries and provide honorable mentions and/or sources -->

Pandas is an open-source package with applications involving analytical computing for which Wes McKinney is the BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life). Wes McKinney holds a Masters Degree in Mathematics, frequently works with financial data, and has been involved with various startups.
